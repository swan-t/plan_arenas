## Phase 4: Graphical Scheduling Interface
**Goal:** Build the core scheduling functionality

### Step 7: Time Slot Management
- [ ] Friday: 19:45-22:30 time slots
- [ ] Saturday: 11:00-19:30 time slots  
- [ ] Sunday: 13:00-19:30 time slots
- [ ] Exception handling for other days
- [ ] Ice time calculation and validation

### Step 8: Drag & Drop Scheduling
- [ ] Visual calendar interface
- [ ] Drag and drop game scheduling
- [ ] Time slot conflict detection
- [ ] Game duration fitting validation
- [ ] Move games between days functionality

### Step 9: Admin Override Interface
- [ ] Admin-only scheduling interface
- [ ] Schedule games at any time
- [ ] Override user restrictions
- [ ] Bulk operations

## Phase 5: Communication & Notifications
**Goal:** Enable team communication and invitations

### Step 10: Email Integration
- [ ] Postmark email service integration
- [ ] Swedish language email templates
- [ ] Game invitation emails
- [ ] Team opponent notifications
- [ ] Email scheduling and queuing

### Step 11: Team Communication
- [ ] Team-specific game lists
- [ ] Opponent contact information
- [ ] Game change notifications
- [ ] Status updates

## Phase 6: Advanced Features
**Goal:** Polish and enhance the user experience

### Step 12: Game Changes & Rescheduling
- [ ] Game change request system
- [ ] Rescheduling workflow
- [ ] Change approval process
- [ ] History tracking

### Step 13: Reporting & Analytics
- [ ] Schedule overview reports
- [ ] Team statistics
- [ ] Arena utilization
- [ ] Export functionality

## Phase 7: Testing & Deployment
**Goal:** Ensure quality and deploy to production

### Step 14: Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for critical components
- [ ] Integration tests for API calls
- [ ] E2E tests for user workflows
- [ ] Performance testing

### Step 15: Production Deployment
- [ ] Glesys server configuration
- [ ] Environment variables setup
- [ ] SSL certificate configuration
- [ ] Monitoring and logging
- [ ] Backup procedures
